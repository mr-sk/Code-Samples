Code-Samples
============

Unfortunately I cannot share many code samples, as they belong to my employer. However, if you are interested in interviewing me, I can speak about all sorts of projects I've worked
on that are not reflected in the samples here. I can also bring along personal projects that are private and share source with you in a meeting. 

I will update this overtime, so 'watch' it for updates. 

In addition, if you came to this URL directly, don't forget to navigate and view a list of all my repositories: https://github.com/mr-sk?tab=repositories
